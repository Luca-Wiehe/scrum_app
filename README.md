# Scrum App
This is the Swift based iOS Application for "Scrumdinger". Scrumdinger is an application to manage meetings according to the Scrum collaboration framework. The app is based on an official tutorial provided by the Apple Developer Platform: https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training. I used this tutorial as a foundation to learn the basics of iOS development and play around with additional iOS features.

## Project Description

### Motivation for Application
Mobile applications allow bridging the gap between high-level architectural planning and user-centric application design. Many projects I have developed in the past, were developed in formats such as Python notebooks or scripts which are not tangible for many audiences. To understand the process of wrapping research or industrial projects in an understandable fashion, I wanted to get in touch with mobile app development.

### Choice of Tech Stack

### Repository Structure
+ `/Resources/`:
+ `/Models/`: Classes and structures for the application's underlying logic
